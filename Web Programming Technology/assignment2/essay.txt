<div style="font-family: Times sans;>In this vast world, there are a number of people we meet every day, but there are some people who stay with us for a lifetime. The term for those people is “Friends” and the emotion that sustains them is “friendship”. The word friendship may have a particular number of alphabets, but the meaning it conveys cannot be measured in numbers. The word “friendship” is more than what meets the eye. The depth it holds in terms of emotions, bonding, trust, understanding, support, communication and much more is unparalleled. At every phase of our lives, we come across people and don’t even realize the bonds that form with time. These bonds are filled with the spirit and essence of trust, honesty, support, etc, thus becoming the pillars of friendship. 

In every person’s life, friendship plays different roles and it is something that sustains you. Now, there are basically 2 types of friends, first ones are those who are good friends while the other ones are best friends. The best friends are the ones that we share a special bond of affection and love with. They make our lives much richer and easier

In true friendship, there is no place for judgment. True friends can share anything they are feeling without the fear of being judged by the other. To put it simply, we can say that true friendship gives us a reason to become even stronger in life.

Friendship makes us stronger in all aspects. No matter how much we fight with our friends, we always come back to them. This is what teaches us to understand and be patient. Without any doubt, we can conclude that there is nothing out there that is nearly as beautiful, and as strong as friendship. Lucky are those who have this blessing in their life. Forever cherish it.
